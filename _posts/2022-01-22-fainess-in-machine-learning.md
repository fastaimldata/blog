## Objectives

The objective of this post is two-fold:

1. Concept Explanations - I wish to explain the main concepts in fairness in very simple and practical terms. For the technically inclined, I would like to provide some depth using mathematics borrowed from [Moritz Hardt et al., 2016](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6374-interaction-screening-efficient-and-sample-optimal-learning-of-ising-models)

2. Learning materials - Record here all the resources which I found useful while delving on the topic of fairness in machine learning

## Concepts

1. Sensitive attributes

2. Demographic parity

3. Equal odds

4. Equal opportunity

5. Fairness through Awareness


## Resources

1. [Attacking discrimination in ML](http://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/)

2. [Equality of opportunity in ML](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/10/equality-of-opportunity-in-machine.html)

3. [Duke slides](https://courses.cs.duke.edu//fall18/compsci590.1/lectures/FairML2.pdf)

4. [Fair ML book](https://fairmlbook.org/)

5. [Moritz Hardt et al., Equality of opportunity in supervised learning](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6374-interaction-screening-efficient-and-sample-optimal-learning-of-ising-models)
