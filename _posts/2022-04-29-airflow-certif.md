I finally got a certification to formally prove my knowledge in Airflow. Several ML and data job openings that I am interested are scouting for skills in creation of data pipelines and particularly in using Airflow. 

I have prior hands-on experience in creating data pipelines to pre-process and prepare raw data collected from the web using luigi. Luigi was originally developed by Erik Bernhardsson and Elias Freider at **Spotify**, generously open-sourced and actively maintained. If you are wondering, there is a nice UI and I remember running batch tasks using multiple machines (This code is closed-source company IP and I am not allowed to release it!).

My prior hands-on experience in creating data pipelines helped me a lot when I started learning Airflow. I am very thankful to [astronomer.ai](https://www.astronomer.io/) for their Airflow fundamentals preparation course. My heartfelt thanks to [Marc Lamberti](https://mu.linkedin.com/in/marclamberti) for his fantastic teaching style. They have invested a lot of time and effort in designing and organising this course. Each video is concise, clear and very effective in explaining Airflow concepts. I very highly recommend taking the [Apache Airflow Fundamentals Preparation](https://academy.astronomer.io/astronomer-certification-apache-airflow-fundamentals-preparation) course. 

> I recommend using astrocloud docker images for Airflow to avoid losing a lot of time in installing Airflow correctly. This is explained in the course videos. If you are interested in trying out some code yourself, please feel free to check out some code here (https://github.com/fastaimldata/astro)

Not content with just the course, I also read some [Guides](https://www.astronomer.io/guides) provided on the astromoer site. I found some of them, like the one on *Airflow Decorators* to be very useful and well-written.

They also provide a verifiable certificate link through credly. Here is mine:
